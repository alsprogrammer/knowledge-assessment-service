Please note the work now is in progress.

The documentation here is a bit incosistent.

## Theoretical basis

The service is based on the idea of statistical approach. The assessment given to a testee is evaluated (using simulation) to determine the threshold that cannot be passed accidentely (of course there is a possibility to pass the assessment knowning nothing, but this possibility is low enough and the tester can set it). 


## Deployment

Coming soon :)
