# Knowledge assessment service

The system is being developed to bring teachers or other organizations the simple yet powerful mean to evalute the knowledge of people.

The service itself is based on Amazon techological stack mostly and is represented as a JSON-RPC service.

## Theoretical basis

The service is based on the idea of statistical approach. The assessment given to a testee is evaluated (using simulation) to determine the threshold that cannot be passed accidentely (of course there is a possibility to pass the assessment knowning nothing, but this possibility is low enough and the tester can set it). 

## The other things to do

Stay tuned! :)
